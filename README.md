# XRD Analysis of Bi-2223 Superconductor

## Overview

This repository contains detailed X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis for the synthesized Bi-2223 superconductor sample. XRD is a non-destructive technique employed to study crystalline structures, providing information on unit cell dimensions and revealing intra-crystalline defects or impurities.

## Key Findings

1. **Phase Determination**: The XRD pattern obtained from the sample pellet of the Bi-2223 superconductor is provided in Figure 1. This analysis is crucial for determining the phase purity and crystallographic planes present.

2. **Diffraction Peaks**: Distinct diffraction peaks were observed at 2-theta values of approximately:
   - 23.94°
   - 28.79°
   - 33.80°
   
   These peaks can be associated with specific crystallographic planes in the bismuth-based superconductor.

3. **Peak Intensities**: The relative intensities of the observed peaks suggest a prominent presence of these crystallographic planes. Furthermore, the relative intensities indicate a certain orientation preference in the crystallites, providing insights into the crystalline orientation of the sample.

4. **Peak Width Analysis**: Analysis of the peak widths can give us insights into the crystallite sizes and potential strain within the crystal lattice. Broader peak widths, as observed from our XRD data, could hint at:
   - Smaller crystallite sizes
   - Presence of strain within the crystal lattice

Both of these factors can potentially influence the superconducting properties of the material.
